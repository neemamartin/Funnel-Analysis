## 🧠 Project Summary

This case study demonstrates:
- **Strong analytical thinking** — translating raw funnel data into layered business insights
- **Practical DAX & data modeling** — binary stage flags, RANKX, SELECTEDVALUE, dynamic text measures
- **Business decision-making** — prioritized recommendations tied directly to measurable funnel outcomes

## 🎯 Business Problem

E-commerce businesses routinely lose revenue at invisible points in their conversion funnel. Without stage-level visibility, optimization is guesswork. This dashboard answers three core questions:

| Question | Answer Provided |
|---|---|
| Where do users drop off? | Stage-by-stage CVR and drop-off % with drill-through |
| Which segment underperforms? | Device × gender breakdown with contribution % and severity |
| Is the problem structural or time-bound? | Monthly trend analysis across all stages (Jan–Apr) |

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

**Source:** [E-commerce Website Funnel Analysis — Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aerodinamicc/ecommerce-website-funnel-analysis?select=home_page_table.csv)

Five CSV tables joined on `user_id`:

| Table | Key Columns | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `home_page_table.csv` | user_id, page | Funnel entry point — all users who visited home |
| `search_page_table.csv` | user_id, page | Users who reached the search/discovery page |
| `payment_page_table.csv` | user_id, page | Users who initiated a transaction |
| `payment_confirmation_table.csv` | user_id, page | Users who completed purchase |
| `user_table.csv` | user_id, date, device, sex | User attributes — primary key for all joins |

---

## 🧱 Data Modeling Approach

- **Binary stage flags** — `visited_home`, `visited_search`, `visited_payment`, `visited_confirm` for clean conditional filtering
- **Funnel progression** — calculated by joining each stage table to `user_table` on `user_id`
- **DAX measures built:** CVR, Drop-off %, Stage Users, Conversion Contribution %, Drop Rank, Drop Severity, Dynamic Insight Text

---

## 📊 Key Results

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Total Users | 90,000 |
| Home → Search CVR | 50% |
| Search → Payment CVR | 13% |
| Payment → Confirm CVR | 7% |
| **End-to-End CVR** | **0.50%** |
| Users who completed journey | 452 |

> 🔴 **Biggest leak:** Search → Payment — 87% of users drop off here

## 📄 Dashboard Structure

### 🖥️ Page 1 — Funnel Overview

**Objective:** High-level snapshot of user movement across all four stages.

**Visuals:**
- KPI cards — Total Users, Stage CVRs, End-to-End CVR
- Horizontal bar chart — Users by Stage (90K → 45K → 6K → ~0)
- Drop-off % bar chart — CVR comparison across stages
- Dynamic insight card — device-aware DAX text

**Screenshot:**

---

### 📉 Page 2 — Segment Analysis

**Objective:** Understand how device and gender segments behave across the funnel.

**Visuals:**
- KPI cards — Blended Mobile CVR (1%), Blended Desktop CVR (0.2%), Device CVR Gap, Segment Snapshot
- Clustered bar — Stage CVR by Device (Home→Search, Search→Payment, Payment→Confirm)
- Bar chart — CVR by Gender (Female 0.34% vs Male 0.30%)

**Key Finding:** Desktop users contribute ~66% of conversions. Mobile CVR is near zero — device gap is the dominant optimization lever.

**Screenshot:**

---

### 📈 Page 3 — Time Trend Analysis

**Objective:** Monitor CVR and drop-off trends monthly (January–April) to separate structural from time-bound problems.

**Visuals:**
- Line chart 1 — Monthly drop-off trend by stage (Search, Payment, Confirm)
- Line chart 2 — Monthly CVR trend by stage transition
- Device and Gender slicers

**Key Finding:** Payment and Confirm drop-off converges upward from March — a worsening late-stage retention problem.

### 🔍 Drill-through Pages — Stage Deep Dive

**Objective:** Click any stage to navigate to a focused breakdown page with segment-level detail.

**How it works:**
1. Drill-through filter applied on `Stage` field
2. User right-clicks a stage (e.g., Search) → Drill through → Stage Deep Dive
3. Page opens filtered to that stage with full segment breakdown

| Stage | Users | Drop-off | Severity | Top Segment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Home | 90,400 | 50% | Medium | All equal |
| Search | 45,200 | 87% | High | Desktop Female (25.37%) |
| Payment | 6,030 | 93% | High | Mobile Female (36.95%) |
| Confirm | 452 | — | Final | Journey complete |

## 🔢 Key DAX Measures

```dax
-- End-to-end conversion rate
End-to-End CVR =
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(SUM(funnel_data[Users]), funnel_data[Stage] = "Confirm"),
    CALCULATE(SUM(funnel_data[Users]), funnel_data[Stage] = "Home")
)

-- Segment contribution
Conversion Contribution % =
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE([Users Converted]),
    CALCULATE([Users Converted], ALL(funnel_data[device], funnel_data[sex]))
)

-- Drop rank by device
Drop_Rank =
RANKX(ALLSELECTED(funnel_data[device]), CALCULATE([Drop Off Users]),, DESC, DENSE)

-- Dynamic insight text (drill-through aware)
Dynamic Insight =
VAR StageName   = SELECTEDVALUE(funnel_data[Stage])
VAR IsLastStage = StageName = "Confirm"
VAR DropLevel   =
    SWITCH(TRUE(),
        [Drop-off % Stage] > 0.6, "🔴 High drop-off",
        [Drop-off % Stage] > 0.4, "🟠 Moderate drop-off",
        "🟢 Low drop-off"
    )
RETURN
    IF(IsLastStage,
        "✅ Final Stage: " & StageName & UNICHAR(10) &
        FORMAT([Stage Users], "#,0") & " users completed the journey.",
        "📍 Stage: " & StageName & "  |  " & FORMAT([Stage Users], "#,0") & " users" & UNICHAR(10) &
        "📈 CVR to next step: " & FORMAT([CVR Stage], "0.0%") & UNICHAR(10) &
        DropLevel
    )
```

> 💡 **Key fix:** `SELECTEDVALUE()` reads the drill-through filter context directly — replacing `ALL()`/`ALLSELECTED()` which were stripping the page-level filter and returning incorrect values.
